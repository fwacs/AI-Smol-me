1. React: All the JavaScript files will share the React dependency as it is the library being used to build the website. 

2. ReactDOM: The "src/index.js" file will use ReactDOM for rendering the App component.

3. App Component: The "src/index.js" file will import the main App component from "src/App.js".

4. CSS Files: Each JavaScript component file will import its corresponding CSS file. For example, "src/App.js" will import "src/App.css", "src/components/Header.js" will import "src/components/Header.css", and so on.

5. Header, Footer, Main, Sidebar Components: These components will be imported and used in the "src/App.js" file to structure the website.

6. 'root' id: The "src/index.js" file will use the 'root' id to render the App component into the DOM.

7. package.json: This file will contain all the dependencies of the project, including React and ReactDOM.

8. .gitignore: This file will list all the files and directories that should be ignored by Git version control system.

9. README.md: This file will contain the basic information about the project.

10. public/index.html: This file will contain the 'root' id which is used by "src/index.js" to render the App component.

11. public/favicon.ico and public/manifest.json: These files will be used by "public/index.html" for setting the favicon and the web app manifest respectively.

12. Component-specific functions: Each component may have its own functions which will be defined and used within the same component. For example, "src/components/Header.js" may have a function to toggle a dropdown menu.

13. State and Props: The state and props will be shared between the components. For example, the state may be defined in "src/App.js" and passed as props to the Header, Footer, Main, and Sidebar components.

14. Event Handlers: Event handlers like onClick, onChange, etc., will be shared between the components. These will be used to handle user interactions with the website.
